# Annotations
PIE annotations are organized according to sets and video clip names. There are 6 types of labels and each has a unique id in the form of `<set_id>_<video_id>_<object_id>`.
Traffic element ids are also tagged with the the initials of the corresponding object, e.g. tl for traffic lights. 

All samples are annotated with bounding boxes using two-point coordinates (top-left, bottom-right) `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`. The bounding boxes have corresponding occlusion tags.
The occlusion values for pedestrians are either 0 (not occluded), 1 (partially occluded >25%) or 2 (fully occluded >75%). Occlusion for other
labels are either 0 (not occluded) or 1 (occluded).

There are three types of labels:<br/>
**Annotations**: These include object bounding box coordinates, occlusion information and frame id. Depending on the type of object additional information is available:

* pedestrian
    * Action: Whether the pedestrian is `walking` or `standing`
    * Gesture: The type of gestures exhibited by the pedestrian. The gestures include  
    `hand_ack` (pedestrian is acknowledging by hand gesture),`hand_yield` (pedestrian is yielding by hand gesture), 
    `hand_rightofway` (pedestrian is giving right of way by hand gesture), `nod`, or `other`.
    * Look: Whether pedestrian is `looking` or `not-looking`.
    * Cross: Whether pedestrian is `not-crossing`, `crossing` the path of the ego-vehicle and `crossing-irrelevant` which indicates that the pedestrian is crossing the road but not in the path of the ego-vehicle.
* vehicle
    * Type: The type of vehicle. The options are `car`, `truck`, `bus`, `train`, `bicycle` and `bike`.<br/>
* traffic_light
    * Type: The type of traffic light. The options are `regular`, `transit` (specific to buses and trains) and `pedestrian`.
    * State: The state of the traffic light. The options are `red`, `yellow` and `green`.
* sign
    * Type: The type of sign. The options are `ped_blue`, `ped_yellow`, `ped_white`, `ped_text`, `stop_sign`, `bus_stop`, `train_stop`, `construction`, `other`.
* crosswalk
* transit_station
    * bus or streetcar station

These annotations are one per frame per label.<br/>
**Attributes**: These include information regarding pedestrians' demographics, crossing point, crossing characteristics, etc. 
The labels include
* age:`child`, `adult` and `senior`.
* gender: `male`, `female`.
* id: Pedestrian's id.
* num_lanes: scalar value, e.g. 2, 4.
* signalized: Indicates whether the crosswalk is signalized. Options are `n/a` (no signal), `C` (crosswalk lines or sign), `S` (signal) and `CS` (signal and crosswalk lines or sign).
* traffic_direction: `OW` (one-way) or `TW` (two-way).
* intersection: Specifies the type of intersection. Options are `midblock`, `T`, `T-right`, `T-left`, `four-way`.
* crossing: `1` (crossing), `0` (not crossing), `-1` (irrelevant).
* exp_start_point: The starting frame of the experiment 
* critical_point: The last frame of the experiment
* intention_prob: A value in range `[0,1]` indicating the average responses for the pedestrian's intention. 
* crossing_point: The frame at which the pedestrian starts crossing. In the cases where the pedestrians do not cross the road, the last frame - 3 is selected. 

**Vehicle**: ego-vehicle sensor data. The options are
 `GPS_speed`, `OBD_speed`, `heading_angle`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `pitch`, `roll`, `yaw`, `acceleration` and `gyroscope`.<br/>

# Video clips
PIE contains 53 video clips split into 6 sets. The clips in each set are continuous, meaning that they belong to a single recording that is divided into chunks. Each video is approximately 10 min long. These clips should be downloaded and placed in `PIE_clips` folder as follows:
```
PIE_clips/set01/video_0001.mp4
PIE_clips/set01/video_0002.mp4
...
```
To download the videos, either run script `download_clips.sh` or manually download the clips from [here](http://data.nvision2.eecs.yorku.ca/PIE_dataset/PIE_clips/) or [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1th9hjcrce8sof1/AADKIF9itB7KmRvgH4iQxvCpa?dl=0).

# Interface

<a name="dependencies"></a>
## Dependencies
The interface is written and tested using python 3.5. The interface also requires
the following external libraries:<br/>
* opencv-python
* numpy
* scikit-learn

<a name="extracting"></a>
## Extracting images
In order to use the data, first, the video clips should be converted into images. 
There are to options to extract the images. The first option is to use script `split_clips_to_frames.sh`.
This script will extract all images from the video clips. Note that this would require approx.  3TB space to save the images. Alternatively, one can use the interface to only extract annotated frames  (which would require 1TB space) as follows:

```
from pie_data import PIE
pie_path = <path_to_the_root_folder>
imdb = PIE(data_path=pie_path)
imdb.extract_and_save_images(extract_frame_type='annotated')
```

Using either of the methods will create a folder called `images` and save the extracted 
images grouped by corresponding video ids in the folder.
```
images/set01/video_0001/
								00000.png
								00001.png
								...
images/set01/video_0002/
								00000.png
								00001.png
								...		
...
```

<a name="usage"></a>
## Using the interface
<a name="parameters"></a>
Upon using any methods to extract data, the interface first generates a database (by calling `generate_database()`) of all annotations in the form of a dictionary and saves it as a `.pkl` file in the cache directory (the default path is `PIE/data_cache`). For more details regarding the structure of the database dictionary see comments in the `pie_data.py` for function `generate_database()`.

### Parameters
The interface has the following configuration parameters:
```
data_opts = {'fstride': 1,
             'data_split_type': 'default',
             'seq_type': 'trajectory',
	     			 'height_rng': [0, float('inf')],
	     			 'squarify_ratio': 0,
             'min_track_size': 0,
             'random_params': {'ratios': None,
                               'val_data': True,
                               'regen_data': True},
             'kfold_params': {'num_folds': 5, 'fold': 1}}
```
`fstride`.  This is used for sequence data. The stride specifies the sampling resolution, i.e. every nth frame is used
for processing.<br/>
`data_split_type`. The PIE data can be split into train/test or val in three different ways. `default` uses the predefined train/val/test split specified in `_get_image_set_ids()` method in `pie_data.py`. `random` randomly divides pedestrian ids into train/test (or val) subsets depending on `random_params` (see  method `_get_random_pedestrian_ids()` for more information). `kfold` divides the data into k sets for cross-validation depending on `kfold_params` (see  method `_get_kfold_pedestrian_ids()` for more information).<br/>
`seq_type`. Type of sequence data to generate (see [Sequence analysis](#sequence)).
`height_rng`. These parameters specify the range of pedestrian scales (in pixels) to be used. For example  `height_rng': [10, 50]` only uses pedestrians within the range of 10 to 50 pixels in height.<br/>
`squarify_ratio`. This parameter can be used to fix the aspect ratio (width/height) of bounding boxes. `0` the original bounding boxes are returned.<br/>
`min_track_size`. The minimum allowable sequence length in frames. Shorter sequences will not be used.


<a name="sequence"></a>
### Sequence analysis
There are three built-in sequence data generators accessed via `generate_data_trajectory_sequence()`.
The type of sequences generated are `trajectory`, `intention` and `crossing`.
To create a custom data generator, follow a similar structure and add a function call to `generate_data_trajectory_sequence()`
in the interface.
